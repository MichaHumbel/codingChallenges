Return the lowest index at which a value (second argument) should be inserted into an array (first argument) once it has been sorted. The returned value should be a number.
For example, getIndexToIns([1,2,3,4], 1.5) should return 1because it is greater than 1 (index 0), but less than 2 (index 1).
Likewise, getIndexToIns([20,3,5], 19) should return 2because once the array has been sorted it will look like [3,5,20] and 19 is less than 20 (index 2) and greater than 5 (index 1).

The input array should be sorted from least to greatest.
