Create a function that takes a string and returns the reversed string. However there's a few rules to follow in order to make the challenge interesting.

Examples

specialReverseString("Edabit") ➞ "Tibade"

specialReverseString("UPPER lower") ➞ "REWOL reppu"

specialReverseString("1 23 456") ➞ "6 54 321"

Notes

The UPPERCASE/lowercase positions must be kept in the same order as the original string (see example #1 and #2 above).
Spaces must be kept in the same order as the original string (see example #3 above).
